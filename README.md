# OdotKeyMe

In this project, I wanted to create a keylogger to understand one of the tools actors would use within cybersec. A keylogger is a piece of software that captures and records the keystrokes of a target machine. When "actors" use a keylogger, the results are often filtered which at times provides info such as passwords, cc numbers and personal info. However, the keylogger is also used for Offensive Security to gain insights of an "actor" system as well.
